Download the DRIVE dataset here: https://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/

## Setup

Run the following requirements .sh file to obtain the needed libraries:
```
sh requirements.sh
```

In order to run this code, please set up the directory as follows:
```
CS168
|-- Scripts
|-- Data
|   |-- DRIVE
|   |   |-- test
|   |   |-- training
|-- README.md
```

## Usage

Run these scripts from within the ```Scripts``` folder

Preprocess the images:
```
python preprocess.py --total_patches 120000 
```

##### train.py

```
Usage: train.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --batch BATCH                           Batch Size [Default - 64]
  --fchu1 FCHU1                           Number of hidden units in FC1 layer [Default - 512]
  --learning_rate LEARNING_RATE           Learning rate for optimiser [Default - 5e-4]
  --training_prop TRAINING_PROP           Proportion of data to be used for training data [Default - 0.8]
  --max_steps MAX_STEPS                   Maximum number of iteration till which the program must run [Default - 100]
  --checkpoint_step CHECKPOINT_STEP       Step after which an evaluation is carried out on validation set and model is saved [Default - 50]
  --loss_step LOSS_STEP                   Step after which loss is printed [Default - 5]
  --keep_prob KEEP_PROB                   Keep Probability for dropout layer [Default - 0.5]
  --model_name MODEL_NAME                 Index of the model [Default - '1']
```

Train our model:
```
python train.py --batch 256 --learning_rate 5e-4 --training_prop 0.9 --max_steps 14000 --checkpoint_step 500 --loss_step 25 
```

##### predict.py

```
Usage: predict.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --fchu1 FCHU1    Number of hidden units in FC1 layer. This should be identical to the one used in the model 
                   [Default - 256]
  --out OUT        Directory to put rendered images to
  --inp INP        Directory containing images for testing
  --model MODEL    Path to the saved tensorflow model checkpoint
  --format FORMAT  Format to save the images in. [Available formats: npz, jpg and png]

```
Example 

Predict on the testing images using our trained model:
```
python predict.py --fchu1 512 --format png --out ../Data/DRIVE/tmp/ --inp ../Data/DRIVE/test/ --model ../Data/models/model1/model.ckpt-7999
```

These commands will train our optimal model. To tune the hyperparameters as we have done in the paper, run train.py and subsequently, predict.py, with the correct options for each individual model.

This code is an adaptation of https://github.com/KGPML/Deep-Vessel. However, we built our own neural network architecture on top of this code. We only used this code to preprocess the images and as a backend for the training. The neural network architecture, the requirements.sh, and the code to obtain the error metrics for the predictions is our original work.
